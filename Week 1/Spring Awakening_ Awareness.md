# Flow with SHE
*Spring Awakening: Awareness*

The grass is growing, the birds are chirping, and if you live in a place of perpetual winter like I do, you can finally see the ground again. Spring time naturally heralds re-birth within our system. We come out of hibernation, or for most humans, intense periods of work, and we feel a sense of renewal. We have more energy, we want to get out of the house and explore, we might spend more time in social circles; there is an overall sense of celebration. It’s the perfect time to begin or re-start a yoga practice!

Yoga is about 5-6 thousand years old. It has many lineages some of which have been passed down through text, while others through direct teaching. Like most exercise, yoga can help to strengthen and lengthen your muscles, increase blood circulation, reduce stress, and connect you with your body. Something that yoga is great at that not all other types of exercise offers, is building awareness.

Greater awareness is an essential key to becoming a better athlete. Knowing what every part of your body is doing at every moment, if and how you are breathing, and where everyone else around you is and what they are doing only makes you better at what you do.

So our focus for March is awareness, and we will start with our bodies. If you are planning on attending class make sure you wear comfortable clothes, and bring a yoga block. If you don’t have a yoga block  a heavy duty water bottle, or tall mason jar will also work.
